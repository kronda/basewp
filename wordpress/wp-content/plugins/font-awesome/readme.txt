Enables easy use of the Font Awesome icon font set from within WordPress. Icons can be inserted using HTML, shortcode, or TinyMCE plugin.

== Description ==

Font Awesome is a pictographic font set of 361 icons. The icons are infinitely scalable and screen reader compatible.

A full list of the 361 Font Awesome icons is available: [FontAwesomeIconsCheatsheet.pdf](http://f.cl.ly/items/2e1b3q3g081M173m070I/FontAwesomeIconsCheatsheet.pdf)

To use any of the Font Awesome icons on your WordPress site you have three options:

__HTML__

All code examples on the Font Awesome site apply: [http://fontawesome.io/examples/](http://fontawesome.io/examples/)

**Examples**

Pencil icon

`<i class="icon-pencil"></i>`

Phone icon

`<i class="icon-phone"></i>`

Chevron left icon

`<i class="icon-chevron-left"></i>`

__Shortcode__

Don't want to worry about HTML tags?  You can use a shortcode in your posts, pages and even widgets to display a Font Awesome icon.

The shortcode to use is `[icon name=name-of-icon]`, where name=X is the class of the icon you would like to use.

**Examples**

Pencil icon

`[icon name=icon-pencil]`

Phone icon

`[icon name=icon-phone]`

Chevron left icon

`[icon name=icon-chevron-left]`

__TinyMCE Plugin__

Select the icon you would like to add to your post or page content from the Glyphs drop-down menu in the Visual Editor.
