msgstr ""

#. Found in faq list item.
msgid "If you're comfortable with PHP and WordPress API, edit the site's template files (probably index.php) and load the custom post types there. Different themes do this differently, so we can't really say what single approach works best. You should look at <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/get_posts\">get_posts</a>, which is part of the WordPress Template Tags system."

msgid "If you want to build sites right away, without becoming an expert in WordPress API and try our <a href=\"http://wp-types.com/\">Views Toolset</a>. You'll be able to load whatever content you need from the database and display it anywhere and in whatever way you choose."

msgid "By default, WordPress will either display your blog posts or a specific page on the home-page."

msgid "To display custom post types on the home-page, you have two options:"
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "We're sorry, but we don't know of any third option which is both free and requires no coding."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "Sure you can! Types, by itself, replaces several other plugins that define custom types and fields. We believe that it does it much better, but it's up to you to decide."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "If you also buy Views, with Toolset, you'll have a complete solution for both <strong>defining</strong> and <strong>displaying</strong> custom data. You can achieve everything that Views does if you're fluent in PHP and know WordPress API. When you buy Views, you're also supporting Types development, but we're not looking for donations. You should consider Views for its value and nothing else."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "We honestly think so. Even if you're an expert developer, do you really enjoy doing the same stuff over and over again? With Views, you can concentrate on the unique features of every new site that you build, without wasting time on routine stuff."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "Views was originally inspired by the Drupal module with the same name. Around 90% of all Drupal sites use the Drupal Views module and many consider it as one of the most powerful features in Drupal. Now, you too can enjoy the same power (and even more), but without any of the complexity of Drupal."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "Yes! You can tell Types to manage any other custom fields. For example, if you're using an e-commerce plugin, you can tell Types to manage product pricing. This will greatly help you display these fields with Types API or with Views."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "Go to Custom fields control, under the Types menu. There, you can tell Types to manage existing custom fields."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "The most important thing is to remember not to define custom post types and taxonomies in more than one place. If you previously defined them in PHP, first, remove your PHP code with the manual definition. The content will appear to temporarily vanish. Don't panic. Now, redefine the same custom post types and taxonomies with Types. Everything will return :-)"

msgid "Types also includes data import from other plugins such as Custom Post UI and Advanced Custom Fields."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "Yes! Types includes its own import and export features, using an XML settings file. If you create a development site, you can easily transfer settings to the production site."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "Types offers a much richer integration, which is simply impossible with separate plugins. For example, you have fine-grained control of where to display custom meta-boxes. Because Types defines both the post types and fields, we have greater control of where things can go."
msgstr ""

#. Found in faq paragraph.
msgid "Additionally, Types is the only plugin that lets you define parent/child relationships between different post types AND use that information to edit child data when editing a parent."
