            Thanks so much for enabling your <strong>Sucuri Security</strong> plugin. This
            product is designed to supplement existing security products. It's not a silver
            bullet for your security needs, but it'll give you greater security awareness
            and better posture, all with the intent of reducing risk.
        </p>

                <b>WARNING:</b> It is very important that you go to the settings page and
                configure the plugin to work in certain way following the configuration of the
                server where your website is being hosted; do not ignore this or else you may
                end up affecting the performance of your website.
